Basically i have created project with a frontend having a 3 web pages, In which one web page is having the functionality of login and logout , second page is having a dashboard of car selling and the third page is about contact us information. This project also consists of backend which i have created using a spring Boot. I have checked all the functionalities and provided the code as well, for running the website a springboot setup is required. here i've also attached the screenshots of login and contact us pages.
